# cashier
A CLI tool for figuring out how to pay down debts

# Prerequistes
You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) (this was developed with Ruby 3.0, but the syntax should be compatible with Ruby 2.6+). If you don't already manage your Ruby versions with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), I highly recommend it; it's available through homebrew and all the other package vectors. You'll also need [bundler](https://bundler.io/).

# Usage
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into its directory.
2. Run `bundle exec lib/cashier.rb`.
3. You'll be walked through the steps of calculating the best places to invest your paycheck to pay down any debts you might have.
